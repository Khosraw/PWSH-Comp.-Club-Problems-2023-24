# Cryptography II

After their first attempt at cryptography, the Rooks noticed that their cryptographic scheme wasn't secure enough. As a replacement, in spirit of their well-known worth of 5 points on a chessboard, they decided to incorporate the number 5 everywhere into their scheme. As before, the Rooks will use the Fibonacci numbers as keys, defined by 
$$F_0 = 1$$ 
$$F_1 = 1$$ 
$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}.$$
As in the first scheme, the Rooks will select a prime $P$. At the start of the key-generating algorithm, a random number $N$ will be selected. When the algorithm needs to produce a key, it will output the remainder of $F_N$ when divided by $P$ and increment $N$ by 5; hence, the next time it needs to generate a key, it will output the remainder when $F_{N+5}$ is divided by $P$. Help prove to the Rooks that their algorithm is still not secure. 

## Input Format

The sample input will consist of two lines. The first line will consist of the prime $P$ $(P \leq 10^9)$. The second line will consist of two separated-integers, two keys that have been generated consecutively. There is no limit on the potential size of $N$. 

## Output Format

A single line containing the next key that would be generated by the encryption algorithm.

### Sample Input

$11$

$3$ $1$

### Sample Output

$3$

### Sample Case Explanation

In the sample case, the generated $N$ was 3. Thus, the first key generated was the remainder when $F_3 = 3$ was divided by 11, which resulted in an output of 3. Then, the second key generated was the remainder when $F_8 = 34$ was divided by 11, which resulted in an output of 1. As a result, the next key that would be generated would be the remainder when $F_{13} = 377$ was divided by 11, which resulted in an output of 3.
