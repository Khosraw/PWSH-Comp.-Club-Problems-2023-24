# Queen's Meeting

There is a meeting of the Queens of the chess kingdom. They are seated in a $N \times N$ grid representing the kingdom. You are given the positions of $K$ Queens. Your task is to find the Queen who needs to travel the least to meet all the other Queens. Note that a Queen can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal.

## Input Format:

The first line of the input will contain two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$ $(1 \leq N, K \leq 10^3)$. The next $K$ lines will each contain two space-separated integers, indicating the row and column of each Queen.

## Output Format:

The output should be a single line containing two space-separated integers, representing the row and column of the Queen who needs to travel the least to meet all the other Queens.
