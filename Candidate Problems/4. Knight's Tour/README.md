# Knight's Tour

Given a $N \times N$ chessboard, find a knight's tour starting from any cell. A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once. If the board is of odd dimensions, return "No solution".

## Input Format:

The input will consist of a single integer $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 10^3)$, representing the size of the chessboard.

## Output Format:

If the tour is possible, print the $N \times N$ board with each cell showing the move number of the knight on that cell. If the tour is not possible, print "No solution".
