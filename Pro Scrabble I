# Pro Scrabble I

Pro Scrabble player Scrab Bull is trying to gain fame by playing at prestigious Scrabble tournaments; however, he cannot attend them all. Given $N$ scrabble tournaments beginning at time $A$ and ending at time $B$, each of which provide $1$ fame, determine the maximum amount of fame Scrab can gather.

## Input Format

The first line contains $N$, the number of Scrabble tournaments. The next $N$ lines contain two positive integers $A$ and $B$ representing the start and end time of a tournament.

## Output Format

A single line containing the maximum amount of fame Scrab can gather. Assume that traveling time is instantaneous.

### Sample Input

$$

$3$ $1$

### Sample Output

$3$

### Sample Case Explanation

In the sample case, the generated $N$ was 3. Thus, the first key generated was the remainder when $F_3 = 3$ was divided by 11, which resulted in an output of 3. Then, the second key generated was the remainder when $F_8 = 34$ was divided by 11, which resulted in an output of 1. As a result, the next key that would be generated would be the remainder when $F_{13} = 377$ was divided by 11, which resulted in an output of 3.
