# Pythons and Ladders II

In this other version of Pythons and Ladders, you navigate up a board from 1-100 with pythons and ladders that may take you upwards and downwards.
However, enemy player Alex Zo is trying to thwart you!
Given a board with $P$ pythons and $L$ ladders, determine the minimum possible number of moves it takes to reach any given square.

## Input Format

The first line contains positive integers $P, L$, the number of pythons and ladders respectively.
The following $P$ lines contain positive integers $A < B$ representing a python on which a player can move downwards.
The following $L$ lines contain positive integers $A > B$ representing a ladder on which a player can move upwards.
The next line contains a positive integer $Q$.
The following $Q$ lines contain a positive integer $N$, a square between 1-100 on the board.

## Output Format

$Q$ lines containing the minimum possible number of moves it takes to reach that square.
