# Pawn's Pawnshop

A pawn runs a pawnshop (no pun intended). The pawn accepts any items with a value of less than or equal to $N$ and sells them for a value that is twice the value they were bought for. 

Given a list of $K$ items, with their respective values, your task is to determine the maximum profit the pawn can make. If any item is not sold, it does not contribute to the expenses or the profit - it is as if the item was never bought.

## Input Format:
The first line of the input will contain two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$ $(1 \leq N, K \leq 10^3)$. The next line will contain $K$ space-separated integers representing the value of each item.

## Output Format:

The output should be a single line containing the maximum possible profit the pawn can make, assuming all items bought are sold.
