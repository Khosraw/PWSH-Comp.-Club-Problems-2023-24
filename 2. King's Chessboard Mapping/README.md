# King's Chessboard Mapping

As the commander of his army, the King needs to keep track of his soldiers' movements on the chessboard for an effective military strategy. The chessboard is an 8x8 grid, and each square is represented by a unique integer. For instance, the square 'A1' corresponds to the integer '1', 'B1' corresponds to '9', and 'H8' corresponds to '64'.

Given N test cases, each containing an integer representing a square on the chessboard, your task is to print the corresponding chess notation for each square.

## Input Format:

The first line of input will contain N, the number of test cases. The following N lines will each contain a single integer, representing a square on the chessboard.

## Output Format:

The output should consist of N lines. Each line should contain the chess notation corresponding to the integer in the input.
