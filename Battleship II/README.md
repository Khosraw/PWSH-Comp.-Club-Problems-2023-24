# Battleship II 

Brian and his friend decide to keep playing Battleship, where each side has $5$ ships $2$, $3$, $3$, $4$, and $5$ units long and $1$ unit wide, but with a twist. 
The missiles they launch hit the $8$ by $8$ board in a $3$ by $3$ square centered at the spot they aim it at. 

Unfortunately, Brian sucks at Battleship (even with all of your help), and he is currently losing. 
However, when his friend isnâ€™t looking, Brian takes a peek at their board. Find the most optimal spot (one that hits the most ship units) to aim his missile at! 

### Input Format

The first line will contain $N$, the number of games played. $N$ groups of $8$ lines forming a $8$ by $8$ grid (with `X` representing the battleship locations and `.` representing the spots with no ship) and an empty line will follow. 

### Constraints

- $0 \leq N \leq 10$
- The friend is guaranteed to have all five battleships still on the board.
- All ships are placed horizontally or vertically.
- Battleships cannot touch one another. 

### Output Format

Output the locations of the most optimal spots to aim at. 
Let the board be represented by a coordinate system (with the first column equal to $1$, second column equal to $2$, etc. and the first row equal to $1$, second row equal to $2$, etc) and a spot on the board be represented by (column, row).  

### Sample Input

```
3 2
XX......
....X...
.X..X..X
.X..X..X
.X..X..X

X.X.X.X.
X.X.X.X.

```

### Sample Output

```
(2,3) (4,3)
(4,7) (6,7)
```

### Sample Case Explanation 

For the first game, at the spots returned (column $2$, row $3$ and column $4$, row $3$), the missile will hit four spots on the battleships, the most out of all possible locations. 

In the second game, at $\left(4,7 \right)$ and $\left(6,7 \right)$ , the missile will hit five spots on the battleships.
