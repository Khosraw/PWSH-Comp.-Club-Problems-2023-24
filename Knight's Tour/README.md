# Bishop's Conquest

A bishop in chess can move any number of squares diagonally. Given an $N \times N$ chessboard, determine the minimum number of moves a bishop needs to reach every cell of the same color as the starting cell. The bishop may revisit cells.

Chessboards are traditionally alternately colored in a checker pattern. This means that, starting from any corner, the board alternates between black and white squares. In other words, if a square is white, then its neighboring squares (to the north, south, east, and west) are black, and if a square is black, then its neighboring squares are white. The bishop can only move to cells of the same color as its starting cell. Assume the bottom left cell of the board is always black.

## Input Format:

The first line of input will consist of a single integer $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 50)$, representing the size of the chessboard.

The second line of input will consist of two integers $a$ and $b$ $(1 \leq a, b \leq N)$, representing the starting cell's row and column respectively.

## Output Format:

The output will consist of a single integer, representing the minimum number of moves required for the bishop to reach every cell of the same color as the starting cell.
