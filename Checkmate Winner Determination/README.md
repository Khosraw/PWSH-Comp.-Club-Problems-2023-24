# Checkmate Winner Determination

In a game of chess, the objective is to checkmate the opponent's king. In this problem, you are given the last move made by both the black and white players. Each move is represented in standard algebraic notation, with a '#' symbol indicating a checkmate.

Your task is to determine the winner of the game. If white has delivered a checkmate, print "White Wins!". If black has delivered a checkmate, print "Black Wins!". It is guaranteed that exactly one of the two moves will end with a '#', indicating a checkmate.

## Input Format:

The input will consist of two lines, each containing a string representing the last move made by the white and black players respectively.

## Output Format:

The output should be a single line containing either "White Wins!" if white has checkmated or "Black Wins!" if black has checkmated.
