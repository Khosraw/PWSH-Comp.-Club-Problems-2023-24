# Missing a Page

Cole is playing a game with some friends. In this game, $R$ red cards, $G$ 
green cards, and $B$ blue cards are laid face up on a table, each with
a point value associated with them. On a round of play, each player picks
up $N$ cards from the table. On his turn, being the optimal strategist that
he is, Cole picks up the unique combination of cards that will score him the
highest point value. However, seeing this, one of Cole's opponents points
out that he may have committed a rules infraction. On the last page of the 
rulebook, which Cole didn't read, it specifies that a player on their turn
must take at most $g$ green cards and at most $b$ blue cards, and that
any player who takes more than this must return all extra cards taken
back to the table. Hearing this,
Cole is distraught; he wants you to find out how many points he could have
lost. Given that $g$ and $b$ are uniformly distributed integers satisfying
$$g \geq 0,\,b\geq 0,\,g+b\leq N,$$
can you help Cole calculate the expected number of points he lost by not
reading the last page, modulo $10^9 + 7$?

*It is possible that Cole's opponent is mistaken and that he did not commit 
a rules infraction; this must be factored into your calculation.*

## Input Format

The first line of input contains $N$. The second line of input contains three
space-separated integers: $R$, $G$, and $B$, respectively. The next line 
contains $R$ space separated integers, representing the point values of the
red cards in ascending order. The next two lines contain $G$ and $B$ 
space-separated integers, each defined analogously. 

## Output Format

A single line containing the expected number of points Cole lost by not
reading the last page of the rulebook modulo $10^9 + 7$.
