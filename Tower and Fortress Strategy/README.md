# Tower and Fortress Strategy

## Description

In the mystical land of Arithmetica, there exists a linear realm represented by a board with `N` magical squares. As a grand strategist, you are tasked with placing two powerful artifacts — a Tower and a Fortress — on this board. The Tower can only be placed on a square that holds a unique magical energy, and the Fortress must be placed on a square such that, if the Tower is at position `A`, then the Fortress is at a position `B`, which has a mystic connection with `A`. The connection is defined by an ancient rule, known only to wise sages, that relates `A` and `B` in a special way. Your goal is to determine how many distinct valid placements of the Tower and Fortress are possible on a board of size `N`. If there are no valid placements, the answer is 0.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^100

### Input Format

- The input consists of a single integer `N`, the size of the board.

### Output Format

- Print a single integer, the number of distinct valid placements of the Tower and Fortress.

### Sample Input

```
10
```

### Sample Output

```
1
```

#### Explanation
For a board of size `10`, there is one valid placement following the ancient rule. The details of how `A` and `B` are connected mystically (which, in reality, involves flipping a bit in the binary representation) are abstracted away in the problem statement, adding an element of mystery and encouraging problem-solvers to discover the underlying pattern themselves. 

#### Code

```java
import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TowerAndFortressStrategy {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        BigInteger N = new BigInteger(scanner.next());
        
        System.out.println(countPlacements(N));
    }

    private static int countPlacements(BigInteger N) {
        if (N.and(N.subtract(BigInteger.ONE)).equals(BigInteger.ZERO))
            return 0;

        int setBits = 0;
        while (!N.equals(BigInteger.ZERO)) {
            setBits += N.and(BigInteger.ONE).intValue();
            N = N.shiftRight(1);
        }

        return setBits - 1;
    }
}
```
